# moodle-tool-linkchecking
Moodle Admin Tool  
  
This plugin is used to search course content and generate lists and statistics on links which are broken or working. Courses depend heavily on media content thus it is important to ensure all links are working as intended. Furthermore, this plugin has the ability to check if links may be upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS, and will update links if the user specifies it to do so.
